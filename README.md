# Muzart

Singe-page guitar tab editor (eventually scores!) built with:

- React
- SVG / Canvas
- Web Audio

This is just a fun personal project, nothing super serious yet. I often stream my work on this project on Twitch. If
you'd like to watch, tune in [here](https://www.twitch.tv/thegedge). I typically stream on the weekend, 12pm â€” 5pm
Eastern.
