# Muzart

Singe-page guitar tab editor (eventually scores!) built with:

- Preact
- SVG / Canvas
- Web Audio

This is just a fun personal project, nothing super serious yet. I often stream my work on this project on Twitch. If you'd like to watch, tune in [here](https://www.twitch.tv/thegedge). I typically stream on the weekend, 12pm â€” 5pm Eastern.

> :warning: I haven't yet been able to find an MIT-compatible soundfont, so there's currently no sound.
> You can drag and drop your own soundfont into the app though (but no guarantee it will load).
